# The Graph 

[The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) provides an easy way to query smart contract data through APIs known as subgraphs. The Graphâ€™s infrastructure relies on a decentralized network of indexers, enabling your dapp to become truly decentralized.

## Quick Start

These subgraphs only take a few minutes to set up by going through these major steps:
1. Initialize your subgraph project
2. Deploy & Publish
3. Query from your dapp
