# The Graph 

The Graph is an indexing protocol that provides an easy way to query blockchain data through APIs known as subgraphs. Using GraphQL, you can specify the exact fields you want to query.

The Graphâ€™s infrastructure relies on a decentralized network of indexers, enabling your dApp to become truly decentralized.

Follow this [quick-start guide](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/quick-start/) to create, deploy, and query a subgraph within 5 minutes.
