# The Graph

The Graph Network is a decentralized indexing protocol for organizing blockchain data. Instead of building and managing off-chain and centralized data stores to aggregate on-chain data, with The Graph, developers can build serverless applications that run entirely on public infrastructure.

Using GraphQL, developers can query any of the curated open APIs, known as subgraphs, to acquire the necessary information they need to drive their dapp. By querying these indexed subgraphs, Reports and dapps not only get performance and scalability benefits but also the built in accuracy provided by network consensus. As new improvements and/or sub-graphs are added to the network, your projects can rapidly iterate to take advantage of these enhancements.
