# The Graph

Getting historical data on a smart contract can be frustrating when building a dapp. [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) provides an easy way to query smart contract data through APIs known as **subgraphs**. The Graphâ€™s infrastructure relies on a decentralized network of indexers, enabling your dapp to become truly decentralized.

Follow this [quick-start](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/quick-start/) guide to create, deploy, and query a subgraph within 5 minutes.


## Why The Graph?

The Graph provides a robust solution for indexing and querying blockchain data. It effectively tackles the challenge of reading blockchain data without creating a centralized bottleneck. With its network of indexers, The Graph offers increased redundancy and quicker query responses. Using GraphQL queries, your dApp can pinpoint exactly the fields it requires.


## Key Features

- **Decentralized Indexing**: Enables indexing blockchain data through multiple indexers, thus eliminating any single point of failure
- **GraphQL Queries**: Provides a powerful GraphQL interface for querying indexed data, making data retrieval super simple.
- **Customizable & Reusable**: Define your own logic for transforming & storing blockchain data. Reuse subgraphs published by other developers.
- **Pay per Use**: No monthly plans. Pay only for [the queries you use](https://thegraph.com/studio-pricing/).
